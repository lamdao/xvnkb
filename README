3. User Guide
3.1. Install
    The install script will help you to do all things:

    [xvnkb2-source]$ ./configure
    [xvnkb2-source]$ make install

    or

    [xvnkb2-source]$ ./configure
    [xvnkb2-source]$ make
    [xvnkb2-source]$ ./install

    and then follow the instructions of the install script.

    See the INSTALL file for more information.

3.2. Launch
    To control the status of xvnkb core (xvnkb.so), launch xvnkb gui

    $ xvnkb

    A small icon of xvnkb will appear on the screen and display the status of
    xvnkb core (input mode), which can be changed by using mouse:
    - Left button: Switch off the Vietnamese typing mode or switch on the previous
      input method,
    - Right button: Activate menu for configuring xvnkb,
    - Middle button: Exit.

    Pesonal configurations (status of current input method, charset,...) are 
    stored in file $HOME/.xvnkbrc and will be restored in the next session of xvnkb.

3.3. Manually install & launch
    In the case you want to do it manually:

    [xvnkb2-source]$ ./configure
    [xvnkb2-source]$ make
    [xvnkb2-source]$ cp xvnkb.so.<version> /path/to/your/lib/folder
    [xvnkb2-source]$ cp xvnkb /path/to/your/bin/folder

    $ export LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/your/lib/folder/xvnkb.so.<version>
    $ <launch xvnkb to control>
    $ <launch your apps here>

3.4. Function
    With your default LANG, xvnkb can help you to input following charsets:
    tcvn, vni, viscii, vps,... but maybe not unicode. So, when you want to input
    unicode, you have to set LANG=UTF-8.

    $ export LANG=UTF-8       # or LANG=en_US.UTF-8 or {something}.UTF-8
    $ <launch your apps here>

    * NOTICE:
    xvnkb works fine with all other charsets when LANG=*UTF-8 is set.

3.5. Hints for advanced users (who don't want to use GUI :)):
    Make core only with default input method = viqr

    $ make core

    Make core with debug (viqr)

    $ make core_debug

    Make core with user defined input method

    $ make core CFLAGS="-DVK_CORE_METHOD=<N>"

    where N: 1=vni, 2=telex, 3=viqr

    Also, you can change input method by setting environment variable
    VK_CORE_METHOD

    $ export VK_CORE_METHOD=1 # vni input method
    $ <launch apps>

    In this case GUI has no effect on the core. Use Alt-Shift to switch
    on/off Vietnamese input method (default is off).

4. Limits
