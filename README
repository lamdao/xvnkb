3. User Guide
3.1. Install
    The install script will help you to do all things:

    [xvnkb2-source]$ ./configure
    [xvnkb2-source]$ make install

    or

    [xvnkb2-source]$ ./configure
    [xvnkb2-source]$ make
    [xvnkb2-source]$ ./install

    and then follow the instructions of the install script.

    See the INSTALL file for more information.

3.2. Launch
    To control the status of xvnkb core (xvnkb.so), launch xvnkb gui

    $ xvnkb

    A small icon of xvnkb will appear on the screen and display the status of
    xvnkb core (input mode), which can be changed by using mouse:
    - Left button: Switch off the Vietnamese typing mode or switch on the previous
      input method,
    - Right button: Activate menu for configuring xvnkb,
    - Middle button: Exit.

    Pesonal configurations (status of current input method, charset,...) are 
    stored in file $HOME/.xvnkbrc and will be restored in the next session of xvnkb.

3.3. Manually install & launch
    In the case you want to do it manually:

    [xvnkb2-source]$ ./configure
    [xvnkb2-source]$ make
    [xvnkb2-source]$ cp xvnkb.so.<version> /path/to/your/lib/folder
    [xvnkb2-source]$ cp xvnkb /path/to/your/bin/folder

    $ export LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/your/lib/folder/xvnkb.so.<version>
    $ <launch xvnkb to control>
    $ <launch your apps here>

3.4. Function
    With your default LANG, xvnkb can help you to input following charsets:
    tcvn, vni, viscii, vps,... but maybe not unicode. So, when you want to input
    unicode, you have to set LANG=UTF-8.

    $ export LANG=UTF-8       # or LANG=en_US.UTF-8 or {something}.UTF-8
    $ <launch your apps here>

    * NOTICE:
    xvnkb works fine with all other charsets when LANG=*UTF-8 is set.

3.5. Hints for advanced users (who don't want to use GUI :)):
    Make core only with default input method = viqr

    $ make core

    Make core with debug (viqr)

    $ make core_debug

    Make core with user defined input method

    $ make core CFLAGS="-DVK_CORE_METHOD=<N>"

    where N: 1=vni, 2=telex, 3=viqr

    Also, you can change input method by setting environment variable
    VK_CORE_METHOD

    $ export VK_CORE_METHOD=1 # vni input method
    $ <launch apps>

    In this case GUI has no effect on the core. Use Alt-Shift to switch
    on/off Vietnamese input method (default is off).

4. Limits
    - Installation script works only if bash exists.

5. Others
    * Create UTF-8 locale
    For instance, your default LANG is en_US. Now you want to create UTF-8
    locale from your defalt LANG. Follow these instructions:

    # mkdir /usr/share/locale/en_US.UTF-8
    # localedef -v -ci en_US -f UTF-8 /usr/share/locale/en_US.UTF-8
    (ignore all warning & error messages)

    But it is better if you create vi_VN.UTF-8 ;)
    # mkdir /usr/share/locale/vi_VN.UTF-8
    # localedef -v -ci vi_VN -f UTF-8 /usr/share/locale/vi_VN.UTF-8

    Some applications (e.g. OpenOffice) use locale info in /usr/lib/locale.
    If your desired locale does not exist in /usr/lib/locale, you have to
    do the same as above or just make a soft link to that folder:

    # cd /usr/lib/locale
    # ln -s /usr/share/locale/en_US.UTF-8 en_US.UTF-8
    # ln -s /usr/share/locale/vi_VN.UTF-8 vi_VN.UTF-8

    * Gtk/Gnome 2.x
    Gtk/Gnome 2.x applications can use xvnkb with X-Input-Method.
    - Temporary setting: right click on input box and choose X-Input-Method
    - Permanent setting:
      o For whole system
        Edit file /etc/gtk-2.0/gtk.modules like this:
        ,--[ /etc/gtk-2.0/gtk.modules ]----------------------------------
        | ...
        |
        | "/usr/lib/gtk-2.0/<gtk-release>/immodules/im-xim.so" 
        | "xim" "X Input Method" "gtk+" "/usr/share/locale" "ko:ja:zh:vi"
        |
        | ...
        |
        | #"/usr/lib/gtk-2.0/<gtk-release>/immodules/im-viqr.so" 
        | #"viqr" "Vietnamese (VIQR)" "gtk+" "/usr/share/locale" "vi"
        |
        | ...
        `----------------------------------------------------------------

      o For normal user:
        Add following line to $HOME/.bash_profile or $HOME/.xinitrc
        ,--[ $HOME/.bash_profile or $HOME/.xinitrc ] --------------------
        | ...
        |
        | export GTK_IM_MODULE=/usr/lib/gtk-2.0/<gtk-release>/immodules/im-xim.so
        |
        | ...
        `----------------------------------------------------------------

      Where:
         <gtk-release>: exactly release number of gtk in your system

      Ex: release number is 2.2.0
         "/usr/lib/gtk-2.0/2.2.0/immodules/im-xim.so"

      More simpler:

         export GTK_IM_MODULE=xim

      Gtk will lookup for you automatically.


Thank you for using xvnkb!!! Have fun!!!
